This is an IDE and emulator (or at least it will be) for a number of old Atari vector based coin-ops. these old machines are a bit of a passion of mine and this project started out as a way to help me in my overall understanding of Asteroids Deluxe while I was restoring an old one of these.

My first targetted emulation is Asteroids Deluxe, but I hope to be able to add Asteroids, Lunar Lander, Battlezone and others at some point.
